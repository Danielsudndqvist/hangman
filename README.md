# Hangman-game

Deployment : 

## Overview
This is and game where you try to guess the correct european country using one letter at a time,
if you guess wrong you use up one of your 6 chanses. 


## Features

### Existing Features
First thing is that we added a random word generator that picks one country but only shows it 
with underlines so you can see how many letters are in the word. We also have a keyboard with separate
buttons for each letter that interacts with the random word. If you press one of the letters in
the random word, the underline changes to the correct letter and also hides the letter you tried.

### Correct answer!
If you manage to guess the correct answer, the game will 
tell you that you won. You can use the reset button to play again.

### Wrong anwer!
If you don't succeed in guessing the correct answer, you get a message that 
says you lost, but it lets you reset the game and try again using the reset button.

### Features Left to Implement
A feature to add in the future is to create a scoreboard and a leaderboard where 
you can see your and others' win streaks.
