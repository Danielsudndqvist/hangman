# Hangman-game

Deployment : 

## Overview
This is and game where you try to guess the correct european country using one letter at a time,
if you guess wrong you use up one of your 6 chanses. 


## Features

### Existing Features
First thing is that we added a random word generator that picks one country but only shows it 
with underlines so you can see how many letters are in the word. We also have a keyboard with separate
buttons for each letter that interacts with the random word. If you press one of the letters in
the random word, the underline changes to the correct letter and also hides the letter you tried.
